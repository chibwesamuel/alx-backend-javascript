# NodeJS Basics

## Introduction
In this project, I delve into the fundamentals of NodeJS, back-end development concepts, and related technologies such as ExpressJS, JavaScript ES6, and more. This repository serves as a learning platform where I explore various tasks to enhance my skills in NodeJS development.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Task 0: Executing basic JavaScript with Node JS**
   - Create a function to display a message using NodeJS.

2. **Task 1: Using Process stdin**
   - Develop a program that interacts with the user through command line input.

3. **Task 2: Reading a file synchronously with Node JS**
   - Implement a function to read and process a CSV file synchronously.

4. **Task 3: Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS**
   - Develop a function to read a CSV file asynchronously using Promises.

5. **Task 4: Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**
   - Build a basic HTTP server using Node's HTTP module.

6. **Task 5: Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**
   - Enhance the HTTP server to handle different endpoints and return plain text responses.

7. **Task 6: Create a small HTTP server using Express**
   - Install and utilize Express to create a small HTTP server.

8. **Task 7: Create a more complex HTTP server using Express**
   - Build upon the previous task by creating a more sophisticated HTTP server using Express.

9. **Task 8: Organize a complex HTTP server using Express**
   - Organize the server structure using Express, controllers, routes, and async file reading.
